# Material Bread Vue Native Debugging Repo

## How to install
- `git clone https://github.com/eaglejs/mb-vue-native.git`
- `cd mb-vue-native`
- `npm i`
- `npm run android` <== Do this with a real android device with USB debugging turned on and connected to your computer.

The app should run with a simple login page that does nothing at the moment.
I did choose to go with the react-native environment here for deployments as expo was hit or miss when I would deploy to a device. installation instructions can be found here. https://vue-native.io/docs/installation.html#For-React-Native-CLI-users
